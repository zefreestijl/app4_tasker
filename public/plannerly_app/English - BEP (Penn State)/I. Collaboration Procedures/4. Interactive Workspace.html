                The project team should consider the physical environment it will need throughout the lifecycle of the project to accommodate the necessary collaboration, communication, and reviews that will improve the BIM Plan decision making process. Describe how the project team will be located. Consider questions like “will the team be collocated?” If so, where is the location and what will be in that space? Will there be a BIM Trailer? If yes, where will it be located and what will be in the space such as computers, projectors, tables, table configuration? Include any additional information necessary information about workspaces on the project.
