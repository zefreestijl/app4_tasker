The core goal of this BIM use is to inspect building energy standard compatibility and seek opportunities to optimize proposed design to reduce structure's life-cycle costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value </strong></p><p>• Save time and costs by obtaining building and system information automatically from BIM model instead of inputting data manually</p><p>• Improve building energy prediction accuracy by auto-determining building information such as geometries, volumes precisely from BIM model</p><p>• Help with building energy code verification</p><p>• Optimize building design for better building performance efficiency and reduce building life-cycle cost</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required </strong></p><p>• Building Energy Simulation and Analysis Software(s)</p><p>• Well-adjusted Building 3D-BIM Model</p><p>• Detailed Local Weather Data</p><p>• National/Local Building Energy Standards (e.g. ASHRAE Standard 90.1)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required </strong></p><p>• Knowledge of basic building energy systems</p><p>• Knowledge of compatible building energy standard</p><p>• Knowledge and experience of building system design</p><p>• Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D Model</p><p>• Ability to assess a model through engineering analysis tools</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information </strong></p><p>• General Services Administration (GSA) (2015). “BIM Guide 05 - Energy Performance.” &nbsp;Version 2.1.
