Authoring tools create models while audit and analysis tools study or add to the richness of information in a model. Most of audit and analysis tools can be used for Design Review and Engineering AnalysisÂ BIM Uses. Design authoring tools are a first step towards BIM and the key is connecting the 3D model with a powerful database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value </strong></p><p>• Transparency of design for all stakeholders</p><p>• Better control and quality control of design, cost and schedule</p><p>• Powerful design visualization</p><p>• True collaboration between project stakeholders and BIM users</p><p>• Improved quality control and assurance</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required&nbsp;</strong></p><p>• Design Authoring Software</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required </strong></p><p>• Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model</p><p>• Knowledge of construction means and methods</p><p>• Design and construction experience</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information </strong></p><p>• Tardif, M.
