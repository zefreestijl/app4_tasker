The BIM provides critical information to the responders to improve the efficiency of the response and minimize safety risks. The real time building information from a building automation system (BAS), along with the static building information, such as floor plans and equipment schematics, can be valuable information in the model. These systems can integrate via a wireless connection and emergency responders can link to an overall system. The BIM coupled with the BAS can display location information regarding emergencies, possible routes to the area, and any other harmful locations within the building.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value </strong></p><p>• Provide police, fire, public safety officials, and first responders access to critical building information in real-time</p><p>• Improve the effectiveness of emergency response</p><p>• Minimize risks to responders</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required </strong></p><p>• Design review software to view Record Model and components</p><p>• Building Automation System (BAS) linked to model data</p><p>• Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) linked to model data</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required </strong></p><p>• Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review BIM model for facility updates</p><p>• Ability to understand dynamic building information through BAS</p><p>• Ability to make appropriate decisions during an emergency</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information </strong></p><p>• Building Information for Emergency Responders.
