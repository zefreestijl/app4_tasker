            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A process in which stakeholders view a 3D model and provide their feedbacks to validate multiple design aspects. These aspects include evaluating meeting the program, previewing space aesthetics and layout in a virtual environment, and setting criteria such as layout, sightlines, lighting, security, ergonomics, acoustics, textures and colors, etc. This BIM use can be done by using computer software only or with special virtual mock-up facilities, such as CAVE (Computer Assisted Virtual Environment) and immersive lab. Virtual mock-ups can be performed at various levels of detail depending on project needs. An example of this is to create a highly detailed model of a small portion of the building, such as a facade to quickly analyze design alternatives and solve design and constructability issues.

            <h3>Potential Value</h3>
            <ul class="standard-list">
                <li>Eliminate costly and timely traditional construction mock-ups</li>
                <li>Different design options and alternatives may be easily modeled and changed in real-time during design review base on end users and/or owner feedbacks</li>
                <li>Create shorter and more efficient design and design review process</li>
                <li>Evaluate effectiveness of design in meeting building program criteria and owner's needs</li>
                <li>Enhance the health, safety and welfare performance of their projects (For instance, BIM can be used to analyze and compare fire-rated egress enclosures, automatic sprinkler system designs, and alternate stair layouts)</li>
                <li>Easily communicate the design to the owner, construction team and end users</li>
                <li>Get instant feedbacks on meeting program requirements, owner's needs and building or space aesthetics</li>
                <li>Greatly increase coordination and communication between different parties. More likely to generate better decisions for design</li>
