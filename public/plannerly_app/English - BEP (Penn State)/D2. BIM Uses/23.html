This includes how the mechanical system operates and how much energy a building uses. Other aspects of this analysis include, but are not limited to, ventilated facade studies, lighting analysis, internal and external CFD airflow, and solar analysis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value&nbsp;</strong></p><p>• Ensure building is operating to specified design and sustainable standards</p><p>• Identify opportunities to modify system operations to improve performance</p><p>• Create a "what if" scenario and change different materials throughout the building to show better or worse performance conditions</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required</strong></p><p>Building Systems Analysis Software(Energy, Lighting, Mechanical, Other)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required&nbsp;</strong></p><p>• Ability to understand and manipulate CMMS and building control systems with Record Model</p><p>• Ability to understand typical equipment operation and maintenance practices</p><p>• Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D Model</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information </strong></p><p>• Ayat E.
