This model can be developed in multiple ways including laser scanning, photogrammetry and/or conventional surveying techniques, depending on what is desired and what is most efficient. Once the model is constructed, it can be queried for information, whether it is for new construction or a modernization project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>- &nbsp;Enhance the efficiency and accuracy of existing conditions documentation</p><p>- &nbsp;Provide documentation of environment for future uses</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Aid in future modeling and 3D design coordination</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Provide an accurate representation of work that has been put into place</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Verify project status with quantity information for progress monitoring</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Provide detailed layout information</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Pre-disaster and post-disaster planning and documentation</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Visualize current and future facility status and plans</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>- &nbsp;Building Information Model authoring software</p><p>- &nbsp;Laser scanning point cloud manipulation software</p><p>- &nbsp;3D Laser scanning</p><p>- &nbsp;Conventional surveying equipment</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>- &nbsp;Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model</p><p>- &nbsp;Knowledge of Building Information Model authoring tools</p><p>- &nbsp;Knowledge of 3D laser scanning tools</p><p>- &nbsp;Knowledge of conventional surveying tools and equipment</p><p>- &nbsp;Ability to sift through mass quantities of data that is generated by a 3D laser scan</p><p>- &nbsp;Ability to determine what level of detail will be required to add “value” to the project</p><p>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Ability to generate Building Information Model from 3D laser scan and/or conventional survey data</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>United States General Services Administration (2009). “GSA Building Information Modeling Guide Series: 03 - GSA BIM Guide of 3D Imaging.” [link]</p><p>Arayici, Y.
