            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A process in the design phase which one or more building energy simulation programs use a properly adjusted BIM model to conduct energy assessments for the current building design. The core goal of this BIM use is to inspect building energy standard compatibility and seek opportunities to optimize proposed design to reduce structure's life-cycle costs.

            <h3>Potential Value</h3>
            <ul class="standard-list">
                <li>Save time and costs by obtaining building and system information automatically from BIM model instead of inputting data manually</li>
                <li>Improve building energy prediction accuracy by auto-determining building information such as geometries, volumes precisely from BIM model</li>
                <li>Help with building energy code verification</li>
                <li>Optimize building design for better building performance efficiency and reduce building life-cycle cost</li>
