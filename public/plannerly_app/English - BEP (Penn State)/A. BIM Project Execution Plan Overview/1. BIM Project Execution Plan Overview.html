                To successfully implement Building Information Modeling (BIM) on a project, the project team has developed this detailed BIM Project Execution Plan. The BIM Project Execution Plan defines uses for BIM on the project (e.g. design authoring, cost estimating, and design coordination), along with a detailed design of the process for executing BIM throughout the project lifecycle.
