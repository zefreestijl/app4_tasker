The record model should, at a minimum, contain information relating to the main architectural, structural, and MEP elements. It is the culmination of all the BIM Modeling throughout the project, including linking Operation, Maintenance, and Asset data to the As-Built model (created from the Design, Construction, 4D Coordination Models, and Subcontractor Fabrication Models) to deliver a record model to the owner or facility manager. Additional information including equipment and space planning systems may be necessary if the owner intends to utilize the information in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aid in future modeling and 3D design coordination for renovation</p><p>Improve documentation of environment for future uses, e.g., renovation or historical documentation</p><p>Aid in the permitting process (e.g. continuous change vs. specified code.)</p><p>Minimize facility turnover dispute (e.g. link to contract with historical data highlights expectations and comparisons drawn to final product.)</p><p>Ability for embedding future data based upon renovation or equipment replacement</p><p>Provide owner with accurate model of building, equipment, and spaces within a building to create possible synergies with other BIM Uses</p><p>Minimize building turnover information and required storage space for this information</p><p>Better accommodate owner's needs and wants to help foster a stronger relationship and promote repeat business</p><p>Easily assess client requirement data such as room areas or environmental performance to as-designed, as-built or as-performing data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required </strong></p><p>under development</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required</strong></p><p>Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review 3D model</p><p>Ability to use BIM modeling application for building updates</p><p>Ability to thoroughly understand facility operations processes to ensure correct input of information</p><p>Ability to effectively communicate between the design, construction, and facilities management teams</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Brown, J.
