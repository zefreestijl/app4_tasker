            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A process in which emergency responders access critical building information in the form of a model and information system to plan for and manage extreme events. The BIM provides critical information to the responders to improve the efficiency of the response and minimize safety risks. The real time building information from a building automation system (BAS), along with the static building information, such as floor plans and equipment schematics, can be valuable information in the model. These systems can integrate via a wireless connection and emergency responders can link to an overall system. The BIM coupled with the BAS can display location information regarding emergencies, possible routes to the area, and any other harmful locations within the building.
