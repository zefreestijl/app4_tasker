The developed BIM model allows the project team to analyze space and understand the complexity of space standards and regulations. Critical decisions are made in this phase of design and bring the most value to the project when needs and options are discussed with the client and the best approach is analyzed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential Value </strong></p><p>• Efficient and accurate assessment of design performance in regard to spatial requirements by the owner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources Required </strong></p><p>• Design Authoring Software</p><p>• Programming software</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team Competencies Required </strong></p><p>• Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References for Additional Information </strong></p><p>• General Services Administration (GSA) BIM Guide 02.
