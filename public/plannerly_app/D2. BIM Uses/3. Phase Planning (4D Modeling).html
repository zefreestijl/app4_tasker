        <div class="content-group">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A process in which a 4D model (3D models with the added dimension of time) is utilized to effectively plan the phased occupancy in a renovation, retrofit, addition, or to show the construction sequence and space requirements on a building site. 4D modeling is a powerful visualization and communication tool that can give a project team the including owner a better understanding of project milestones and construction plans.

            <h3>Potential Value</h3>
            <ul class="standard-list">
                <li>Better understanding of the phasing schedule by the owner and project participants and showing the critical path of the project</li>
                <li>Dynamic phasing plans of occupancy offering multiple options and solutions to space conflicts</li>
                <li>Integrate planning of human, equipment and material resources with the BIM model to better schedule and cost estimate the project</li>
                <li>Space and workspace conflicts identified and resolved ahead of the construction process</li>
                <li>Marketing purposes and publicity</li>
                <li>Identification of schedule, sequencing or phasing issues</li>
                <li>More readily constructible, operable and maintainable project</li>
                <li>Monitor procurement status of project materials</li>
                <li>Increased productivity and decreased waste on job sites</li>
                <li>Conveying the spatial complexities of the project, planning information, and support conducting additional analyses</li>

            <ul class="standard-list">
                <li>Knowledge of construction scheduling and general construction process. A 4D model is connected to a schedule, and is therefore only as good as the schedule to which it is linked.</li>
                <li>Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model.</li>
                <li>Knowledge of 4D software: import geometry, manage links to schedules, produce and control animations, etc.</li>
