            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A process in which 3D software is used to develop a Building Information Model based on criteria that is important to the translation of the building's design. Authoring tools create models while audit and analysis tools study or add to the richness of information in a model. Most of audit and analysis tools can be used for Design Review and Engineering Analysis BIM Uses. Design authoring tools are a first step towards BIM and the key is connecting the 3D model with a powerful database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules.
