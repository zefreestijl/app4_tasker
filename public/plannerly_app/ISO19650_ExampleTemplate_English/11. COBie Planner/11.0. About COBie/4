It provides benefits for all the stakeholders involved in a project, being Designers, Consultants, Facility Managers, Contractors, and Owners, as it is a placeholder for later exchange/retrieval, which can be made a standard in contract documents, as BEP. One of COBie major benefits is to be a generic source of information which can be acceptable to all large and small contractors, suppliers, owners, etc.</p>
<p>COBie can act as tool for data bridge between both. It adds no cost to Operations &amp; Maintenance, as it can be extracted from a BIM Model and imported into Digital Asset Management solutions, avoiding data re-entry associated cost and providing higher quality data.</p>
<p>Most of the information required for Operations &amp; Maintenance is non geometrical, as the geometrical component is only there to help the user to locate the assets. Not all data needs a model, nevertheless, it can be modified and manipulated very easily inside authoring platform.</p>
<p><strong>Well planned COBie requirements save up to 6 weeks in a project!<img src="https://private.lodplanner.com/projects/35372/plan-content/1673511598563_8d77ce03-d444-4f67-8d12-c042cbd9a4d2.jpg?Expires=1768831279&amp;Signature=MICW2AotxLsVcV7bAW3l1mJYKEuREjOmwD2OwGQbpHPHYpvFgF6qiCD3nWe3EFzrAxTCg0Faesjel~SkwK8oEnnrzdR~WKdHh9mkj6wpRedhy4HnR1MlxayKDy4U4mR7RmujypnF3QPWD8urYDKyceIMoUky0pU~KpR3GA1TaYruesXDWFzW9tAAIoo9~Ojjd74hVeN5stRphA3~rxvmy~-1BpbswOixO1FmGujA1xqcdNTKG6U7vPUQLH-qCmR97wt-6nEhUSlE8zKVPDX7~xNNZuHdDJmdldM3wOmEkpOHEmaFXjfAXX~dffnRXAqV24PDBQi7V9TFr3aCa4Yb2Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJRIVA6WNZT4BZJPQ" style="width: 800px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></strong></p>
