        <p>
            As COBie is editable in a simple <strong>XML/Spreadsheet format</strong>, it is within easy reach of all involved parties. It provides benefits for all stakeholders—Designers, Consultants, Facility Managers, Contractors, and Owners—acting as a standardized placeholder for data retrieval that can be mandated in contract documents like the <strong>BEP (BIM Execution Plan)</strong>.
        </p>
    
        <div style="background-color: #f0f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #2c82c9; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <p style="margin: 0; color: #333; line-height: 1.6;">
                COBie acts as a <strong>data bridge</strong> between project phases. It adds no additional cost to Operations & Maintenance (O&M) because it can be extracted directly from a BIM Model and imported into Digital Asset Management solutions, avoiding the high costs associated with manual data re-entry and ensuring higher data quality.

        <p>
            Most of the information required for O&M is <strong>non-geometrical</strong>; the geometric component primarily exists to help the user locate assets. While not all data requires a 3D model, it can still be easily manipulated within BIM authoring platforms.

                Well-planned COBie requirements save up to 6 weeks in a project!
