        <p>
            The purpose of this document is to serve as a comprehensive guide for <strong>COBie (Construction Operations Building information exchange)</strong>, a critical tool designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of data from the design phase through construction to final handover.

                Among the available options for integrating information into downstream phases, COBie is a standout solution because it remains <strong>vendor-neutral and open-source</strong>. This makes it particularly relevant in the current industry landscape where <strong>OpenBIM</strong> is a primary focus for ensuring data remains useful throughout the entire life of the project.
