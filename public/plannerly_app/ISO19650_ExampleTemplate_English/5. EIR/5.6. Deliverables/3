<ol>
<li>Evidence of the <strong>functionality and effectiveness of the architectural provisions</strong>
</li>
<li>Details of the <strong>functioning of building services engineering systems and controls</strong>
</li>
<li>Details of the post-occupancy evaluation (POE) at the end of Years 1, 2 and 3 to establish feedback on functionality and effectiveness</li>
<li>POE results recorded with details of any required corrective action</li>
<li>Evidence of a recognized method of calculation being used to provide an <strong>estimate of the expected CO2 emissions for the year</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Annual review of energy use</strong> and a calculation of CO2 emissions that has been conducted</li>
<li>
<strong>Records of any fine-tuning</strong> or behavioral changes introduced to improve operational performance</li>
<li>Details of any operational changes, where applicable</li>
<li>Evidence that a comparison of <strong>actual and predicted operational costs</strong> is being maintained</li>
<li>Records of any procedural changes made to improve operational costs whilst still delivering the required service levels</li>
<li>Records of <strong>metered consumption of water</strong>
</li>
<li>Records of <strong>measured waste reduction and disposal</strong>
</li>
<li>Details of <strong>actual operational costs</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Documented experiences and lessons learned</strong></li>
<li>Evidence that the findings from the first year of measurement of performance have been coordinated with the sign-off of the first year of the defects liability period</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Documenting experiences and lessons learned</strong>, together with feedback on performance, avoids the situation of valuable know-how disappearing when personnel leave any organization.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
