    <div class="section-label">High Level Purpose of Information</div>

    <p>
        Per ISO 19650-1 "5.1 Principles" we describe in the table below the high level purposes of information required to support our organizational and/or project objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any Appointed Party can suggest the addition of their own information requirements to this list. The resultant requirements from this list will form the Information Delivery Milestones at certain Stages in the project <strong>Scope</strong>.
    </p>

    

    <p>
        Where information exchange within a delivery team is necessary, some of the information requirements can be passed to their own appointed parties through the assignment in the <strong>Scope</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>The reasons why information is required during the project are listed below:</p>
