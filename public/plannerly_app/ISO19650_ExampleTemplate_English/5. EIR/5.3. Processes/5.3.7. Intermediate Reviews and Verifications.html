    <p>
        The Lead Appointed Party shall define a process for peer review and verification during design and at key points during construction. These intermediate checks should be aligned with the <strong>Key Decision Points</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peer review and verification should be used to test the ability of the proposed design and construction to meet the required <strong>environmental, social, security and economic performance</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design and construction team should inform the Appointing Party's Information Manager of the topics to be peer-reviewed and verified, the personnel required for this purpose and the method by which outputs will be captured and made available in subsequent work stages.
