    <p>
        Changes to the scope of work required to deliver the project might be necessary or might be proposed by the Appointing Party or a key stakeholder. A change might have implications for the design or other attribute of the scope, such as its <strong>cost, schedule or performance</strong> in use.
    </p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: #555; border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 10px;">
        It is <strong>important to distinguish between a change to the design and design development</strong>, where the latter is a matter of increasing detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        A <strong>design change control procedure</strong>, incorporating a design change protocol, should be implemented to evaluate proposed changes to the design before they are submitted for approval.
    </p>

    <div class="subsection-box">
        <h3 class="subsection-title">Design Change Protocol Requirements</h3>
        <p>The protocol should record details of the proposed change, including:</p>
        <ol style="margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
            <li><strong>Description</strong> of the proposed change</li>
            <li><strong>Justification</strong> for the change (e.g. if the scope of work is unsafe or inoperable, or if value improvement is sought)</li>
            <li><strong>Basis of the design</strong> (e.g. description and details of the system, component, process or activity to which it relates)</li>
            <li><strong>Impact on end-users</strong> of the asset/facility, including disabled people and others with equalities-related needs</li>
            <li><strong>Impact on the whole-life cost</strong> of the asset/facility and schedule for construction work and/or installation, and on operations and their cost</li>
            <li><strong>Authority</strong> responsible for approving the change</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Approved changes to the design should be reported formally to the Appointing Party</strong> at intervals, as necessary, reflecting the extent and urgency of the change and the time required for design or redesign.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design and construction team should allow for the review of the 3D model, drawings and specifications and comment by the Appointing Party and the operator, operations team or facility manager, as appropriate.
