        <p>
            There are many risks that could impact our project <strong>cost, schedule, and performance</strong> - some
            of these could even lead to disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to manage these risks we will carry out some early planning to catalog potential challenges and
            their mitigation measures. We will use the following <strong>three step process</strong>:
        </p>



        <div class="subsection-box">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">Risk Management Process</h3>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <strong>1. Discussion</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
                    The discussion stage will involve quick online brainstorming sessions with the project team and
                    stakeholders to identify risks. At this point, we are not looking to solve any problems - the goal
                    is to identify as many possible scenarios that could negatively impact the project. We will also
                    review the risk registers from past projects with similar size, scope, and location. The results
                    will be listed as potential risks and classified in groups (e.g., "Potential Design Risks").
                </p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <strong>2. Evaluate</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
                    To evaluate the risks we will analyze the qualitative and quantitative impacts on the project along
                    with their probability. The team will then decide which are the priority items that require
                    additional planning for specific mitigation measures.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <strong>3. Mitigate</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
                    Appropriate steps to mitigate each of these risks will then be planned and assigned an owner for the
                    duration of the project.
