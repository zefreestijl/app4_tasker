<p><strong>A change might have implications for the design</strong> or other attribute of the scope, such as its <strong>cost, schedule or performance</strong> in use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is <strong>important to distinguish between a change to the design and design development</strong>, where the latter is a matter of increasing detail.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the design will be avoided unless considered necessary</strong> for reasons of safety or inoperability of installations and/or equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes might be necessary where the results of peer reviews and verification show that the required performance or other outcome or objective cannot be met.</p>
<p>A <strong>design change control procedure</strong>, incorporating a design change protocol, should be <strong>implemented to evaluate proposed changes</strong> to the design before they are submitted for approval to the owner and/or operator so that the full implications for the correct and safe operation of the asset/facility can be verified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This design change protocol should record details of the proposed change, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Description of the proposed change</li>
<li>Justification for the change (e.g. if the scope of work is unsafe or inoperable, or if value improvement is sought)</li>
<li>Basis of the design (e.g. description and details of the system, component, process or activity to which it relates)</li>
<li>Impact on end-users of the asset/facility, including disabled people and others with equalities-related needs</li>
<li>Impact on the whole-life cost of the asset/facility and schedule for construction work and/or installation, and on operations and their cost</li>
<li>Authority responsible for approving the change</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Approved changes to the design should be reported formally to the Appointing Party</strong> at intervals, as necessary, reflecting the extent and urgency of the change and the time required for design or redesign.</p>
<p>The design and construction team should allow for the review of the 3D model, drawings and specifications and comment by the Appointing Party and the operator, operations team or facility manager, as appropriate.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
