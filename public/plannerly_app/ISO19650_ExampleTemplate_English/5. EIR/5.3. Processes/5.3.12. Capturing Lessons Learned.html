    <p>
        On all projects we seek to build on our experience from completed projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of documented <strong>Lessons Learned</strong> is to improve the outcomes on this project but also to provide future project teams with information that can increase their efficiency and effectiveness.

            <strong>Lessons Learned</strong> will be captured throughout all project stages.
        </p>
        <p>
            In collaboration with each <strong>Lead Appointed Party</strong>, the <strong>Appointing Party</strong> shall capture lessons learned during the project and record them here in the <strong>Lessons</strong> so that they can be called upon by future projects.
