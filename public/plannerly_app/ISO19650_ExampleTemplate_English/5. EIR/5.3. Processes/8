<p>Options should <strong>allow for the measurement of environmental, social, security and economic performance, and comparison with the required outcomes</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, the design and construction team should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Indicate when alternative solutions (e.g. designs, materials, products and systems) are available&nbsp;</li>
<li>Inform the Appointing Party which solution (or combination) optimizes energy use and minimizes CO2 emissions and whole-life cost</li>
<li>Be explicit when deciding on any matter that could impact on operations, in particular energy use, CO2 emissions, water consumption, waste disposal and whole-life cost</li>
<li>Obtain information from manufacturers on the operational costs (including maintenance), breakdown frequency, lifetime of system components/parts (including the energy consumed by them) and other information required by the Appointing Party</li>
<li>Obtain current lead times for building services engineering systems and other major components and systems</li>
