    <p>
        The <strong>options available to satisfy functional, technical, operational and end-users’ needs</strong> and the extent to which these can be practically achieved should be assessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Options should <strong>allow for the measurement of environmental, social, security and economic performance, and comparison with the required outcomes</strong>.

            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Indicate when alternative solutions (e.g. designs, materials, products and systems) are available.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Inform the Appointing Party which solution (or combination) optimizes energy use and minimizes CO2 emissions and whole-life cost.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Be explicit when deciding on any matter that could impact on operations, in particular energy use, CO2 emissions, water consumption, waste disposal and whole-life cost.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Obtain information from manufacturers on the operational costs (including maintenance), breakdown frequency, lifetime of system components/parts (including the energy consumed by them) and other information required by the Appointing Party.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Obtain current lead times for building services engineering systems and other major components and systems.</li>
