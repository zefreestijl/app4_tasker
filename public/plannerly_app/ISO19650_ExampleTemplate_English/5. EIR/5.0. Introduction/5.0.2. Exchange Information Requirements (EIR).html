    <p>
        <strong>Exchange Information Requirements (EIR)</strong> specify our base requirements for Building Information Modeling (BIM) in line with <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68078.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>ISO 19650</strong></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We seek standardized good quality information that can be exchanged, integrated and interrogated <strong>during project delivery and following Handover</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>EIR</strong> contains our strategy, Key Performance Indicators, BIM Uses, and desired outcomes from the use of BIM on our project. It has sections completed by us as the Appointing Party (or by a Representative, Advisor or Consultant that we have appointed) to identify our project specific requirements.
    </p>

    

    <p>Our information requirements resources include the following documents:</p>
