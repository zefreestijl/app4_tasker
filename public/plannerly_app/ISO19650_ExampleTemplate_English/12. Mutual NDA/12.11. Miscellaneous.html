            <strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Amendments:</strong> This Agreement may only be amended by a written document signed by both parties.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
        </p>

                <strong>Implementation Note:</strong> These "Boilerplate" clauses protect the integrity of the contract. The <em>Severability</em> clause, in particular, ensures that a single legal error does not invalidate the entire non-disclosure protection.
