<table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Benefits:</div></th></tr></thead></table>
<ul>
<li>Appointing Party receives 2D and 3D documentation of the projects as-built conditions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Appointing Party has the opportunity to incorporate the 3D as-built model into Facility Management software.</li>
</ul>
<table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Process:</div></th></tr></thead></table>
<ul>
<li>The Design Team produces the design documents with Revit, CAD Mech, AutoCAD, or other BIM software best adapted to the teams' skills.</li>
<li>Throughout the project, any design changes are developed using the native models. The team produces Bulletins, ASI's and other changes using these models.</li>
<li>During construction, responses to RFIs and other field issues are recorded by the Construction Team.</li>
<li>The construction "red-lines" will be incorporated into the fabrication model by the Construction Team on a monthly basis.</li>
<li>After “red-lines” are incorporated into the fabrication model, the updated drawing sheets are published as agreed upon.</li>
<li>This process repeats during the construction of the project.</li>
<li>MEP Subcontractors will maintain separate “red lines” for their trade work and will incorporate their field changes into their fabrication models and revise their shop drawings/submittals accordingly to be current throughout construction. If models aren’t able to be coordinated or delivered by the Subcontractor, the Subcontractors’ consulting team will be required to deliver the same level of deliverables and to match the same expectations as the Subcontractor.</li>
<li>At the end of construction the Construction Team verifies that the models contain all applicable RFI's, design changes, etc. The models and 2D documents are then submitted to the client for review and comment on compliance with project requirements.</li>
<li>The Construction Team reviews Appointing Party comments and advises team of necessary changes.</li>
<li>The Construction Team submits the final As-Built models/drawings in accordance with the project As-built requirements.</li>
<li>RFI's – Tracked by the construction management team on the project set of as-built drawings. RFI’s should be posted within the same week they were published and updated to the BIM model on a monthly basis or as necessary for coordination.</li>
<li>Field changes – Field changes should be redlined by subcontractors and tracked by the Construction Management team on the project set of as-built drawings on a weekly basis. These redlines should be updated to the BIM model on a monthly basis or as necessary for coordination.</li>
<li>Appointing Party requirements – Appointing Party requirements and changes should be documented and posted to the project set of as-built drawings within the same week they are published by Construction Management team. These changes should be updated to the BIM model on a monthly basis or as necessary for coordination.</li>
<li>Design changes – Design changes are published by the design team to the BIM model to produce the revised contract documents. The revised model and contract documents are transferred to the Construction Manager concurrently. The project set of as-built drawings are updated with the new drawings sheets and any existing changes are updated to the new drawings. The Construction Team distributes the updated models for subcontractor incorporation.</li>
<li>Addition or Deletion of detail (hangars, VAV Clear Space, etc.) – Adding or deleting the level of detail/information produced by the subcontractors for fabrication should be updated in the subcontractors as-built model/drawings on a weekly basis.</li>
<li>As-Builts / Record Models shall be maintained with current info throughout the construction of the project to reflect any and all changes from the original design. Models shall be updated on a monthly basis.</li>
<li>At project completion, aggregate As-builts / Record Models shall be submitted to the owner in accordance to the project As-Built requirements.</li>
</ul>
<table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Software / Hardware:</div></th></tr></thead></table>
<ul>
<li>Native 3D modeling software programs - As-builts/ Record Models need to be maintained and updated using the native software that was used to create the original models and design documents. For any changes that occur during the construction phase, the model can be modified to reflect the new field conditions. BlueBeam Revu - used to digitally mark-up the contract documents.</li>
<li>Depending on the deliverable type, determine if hardware (i.e. tablets) or software (Navisworks or other) is to be included as part of the deliverable at the close out of the job as coordinated in the BIM Execution Planning phase.</li>
</ul>
<table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Deliverables/Expectations:</div></th></tr></thead></table>
<p>The deliverables are to align the project BIM Execution Plan and project as-built requirements.&nbsp;Often these goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design Models, in their native format, incorporating all design changes</li>
<li>Fabrication models, in their native format, incorporating all construction changes</li>
<li>2D As-Built documentation (printed design documents)</li>
<li>2D “Redlined” As-Built documentation (Contract Documents incorporating Subcontractor / Construction Manager design updates)</li>
</ul>
<table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Team Competencies Required:</div></th></tr></thead></table>
<ul>
<li>Design Team - updates the Models periodically throughout construction to reflect changes and clarifications to the project to reflect design revisions made during the construction phase (I.e. Construction Administration) including but not limited to RFIs, ASIs, Change Orders, etc.</li>
<li>Owners – are required to determine the acceptable format and media that is to be delivered to them at the close of a job. Establish all expectations during the BIM Execution Planning effort that limits confusion and misalignment downstream.</li>
<li>Subcontractors - update their individual fabrication models to show any changes affecting their trade's work, and submit the final conditions models to the Construction Manager at the end of each phase of construction in native format. Typically, all 2D documentation should utilize the same title block, CAD standards, sheet size, etc. which were developed originally from the Design Team.</li>
<li>Construction Team – Assists both the design team and subcontractors to maintain field changes and notations for incorporation into the models. Maintains the official construction documents with red-line changes and performs the QC check of periodic model updates based on red-line documentation.</li>
