            The purpose of documented <strong>Lessons Learned</strong> is twofold: to improve the immediate outcomes of this project and to provide future project teams with historical data that increases their <strong>efficiency and effectiveness</strong>.

            In collaboration with each <strong>Lead Appointed Party</strong>, the <strong>Appointing Party</strong> shall capture insights during the project lifecycle and record them here. This ensures that valuable knowledge is institutionalized rather than lost at the conclusion of the contract.
