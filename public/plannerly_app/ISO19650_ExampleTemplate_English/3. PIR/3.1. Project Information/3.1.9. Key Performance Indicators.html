                            As equipment gets older, it inherently becomes more difficult to maintain. Age doesn’t always correspond with faulty equipment, though, so it’s important to make sure that even newly installed equipment performs as optimally as expected. Tracking the mean time between failures for the overall piece of equipment and for individual pieces can give you one of the best indications of whether or not you should start planning for a major capital investment.

                            To know whether or not you should start planning for a capital investment, keep tabs on the times and dates that equipment suffers a defect that requires maintenance, track the amount of time between each date (per piece of equipment), then calculate the average time. As the mean shrinks lower and lower, you can more easily make the determination if continued planned maintenance or a complete replacement is more cost-effective.
