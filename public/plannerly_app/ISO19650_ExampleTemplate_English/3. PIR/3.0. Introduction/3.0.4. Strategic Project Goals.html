        <ul class="styled-checklist">
            <li>Standardize the production process and maintain uniformity.</li>
            <li>Create a standardized data structure that allows data to be reused, and eliminates redundant and conflicting information.</li>
            <li>Decrease waste by utilizing a virtual building process to simulate design & construction activities.</li>
            <li>Reduce CAPEX (capital expenditure) costs with better informed decision making and greater coordination & collaboration amongst project teams.</li>
            <li>Allow the Design and Construction models to be used for building operations without adding significant costs or time to the Design & Construction process.</li>
            <li>Visual communication of site conditions for planning and health/safety/risk assessment.</li>
            <li>More accurate project phasing and timelines.</li>
            <li>More accurate budgeting and cost estimating, ensuring the project is constructed with the least variations / clashes as possible.</li>
            <li>Fully clash detected models that reduce RFI’s requesting data on object location, with an emphasis on clash avoidance.</li>
            <li>Utilize 3D models for reporting, review and decision making.</li>
            <li>Ensure that there is coordinated, quality Design documentation to estimate the build cost.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the constructibility and methodology of the design have been assessed before documents are issued for construction.</li>
        </ul>
