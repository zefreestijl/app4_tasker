    <p>
        A process in which the functionality of the building structure (walls, floors, roof, etc) and equipment serving the building (mechanical, electrical, plumbing, etc) are maintained over the operational life of a facility.
    </p>
    <p>
        A successful maintenance program will improve building performance, reduce repairs, and reduce overall maintenance costs.
