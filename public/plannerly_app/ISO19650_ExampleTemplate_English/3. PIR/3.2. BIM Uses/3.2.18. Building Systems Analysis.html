    <p>
        A process that measures how a building's performance compares to the specified design.
    </p>
    <p>
        This includes how the mechanical system operates and how much energy a building uses. Other aspects of this analysis include ventilated facade studies, lighting analysis, internal and external CFD airflow, solar analysis and others.
