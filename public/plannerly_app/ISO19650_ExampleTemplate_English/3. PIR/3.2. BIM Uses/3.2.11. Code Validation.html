    <p>
        A process in which code validation software is utilized to check the model parameters against project specific codes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This process allows teams to check models for code compliance, code validation and other model verification uses such as 3D model cost estimation and facility management information requirements.

            <li>Validate that building design is in compliance with specific codes, e.g. IBC International Building Code, ADA Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines and other project related codes using the 3D BIM model.</li>
            <li>Code validation done early in design reduces the chance of code design errors, omissions or oversights that would be time consuming and more expensive to correct later in design or construction.</li>
            <li>Code validation done automatically while design progresses gives continuous feedback on code compliance.</li>
            <li>Reduced turnaround time for 3D BIM model review by local code officials or reduced time that needs to be spent meeting with code commissioners, visiting the site, etc. or fixing code violations during punch list or closeout phase.</li>
            <li>Saves time on multiple checking for code compliance and allows for a more efficient design process since mistakes cost time and money.</li>
