Based on this analysis further development and reinfinement of the structural design takes place to create effective, efficient, and constructible structural systems. The development of this information is the basis for what will be passed onto the digital fabrication and construction system design phases.</p><p>This BIM Use does not need to be implemented from the beginning of the design to be beneficial. Often structural analysis is implemented at the connection design level to make fabrication quicker, more efficient and for better coordination during construction. Another application is that this relates and ties into is construction system design, examples include but not limited to: erection design, construction means and methods, and rigging. The application of this analysis tool allows for performance simulations that can significantly improve the design, performance, and safety of the facility over its lifecycle.</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Potential Value:&nbsp;</div></th></tr></thead></table><ul><li>Save time and cost on creating extra models</li><li>Easier transition BIM authoring tools allowing new firms implementing this use model</li><li>Improve specialized expertise and services offered by the design firm</li><li>Achieve optimum efficient design solutions by applying various rigorous analyses</li><li>Faster return on investment with applying audit and analysis tools for engineering analyses</li><li>Improve the quality of the design analyses</li><li>Reduce the cycle time of the design analyses</li></ul><table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Resources Required:</div></th></tr></thead></table><ul><li>Design Authoring Tools</li><li>Structural Engineering analysis tools and software</li><li>Design standards and codes</li><li>Adequate hardware for running software</li></ul><table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Team Competencies Required:</div></th></tr></thead></table><ul><li>Ability to create, manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D Structural Model</li><li>Ability to assess a model through engineering analysis tools</li><li>Knowledge of constructability methods</li><li>Knowledge of analytical modeling techniques</li><li>Knowledge of structural behavior and design</li><li>Design experience</li><li>Integration expertise pertaining to building systems as a whole</li><li>Experience in structural sequencing methods</li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>
