    <p>
        A process in which a project team develops a 3D model of the existing conditions for a site, facilities on a site, or a specific area within a facility.
    </p>
    <p>
        This model can be developed in multiple ways: including laser scanning and conventional surveying techniques, depending on what is desired and what is most efficient. Once the model is constructed, it can be queried for information, whether it is for new construction or a modernization project.
