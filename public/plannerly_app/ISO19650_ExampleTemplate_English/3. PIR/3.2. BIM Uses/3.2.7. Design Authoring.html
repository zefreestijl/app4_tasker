        A process in which 3D software is used to develop a Building Information Model based on criteria that is important to the translation of the building's design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two groups of applications at the core of a BIM-based design process are design authoring tools and audit/analysis tools. Authoring tools create models while audit and analysis tools study or add to the richness of information in a model. Most of audit and analysis tools can be used for Design Review and Engineering Analysis BIM Uses. Design authoring tools are a first step towards BIM and the key is connecting the 3D model with a powerful database of properties, quantities, means and methods, costs and schedules.
