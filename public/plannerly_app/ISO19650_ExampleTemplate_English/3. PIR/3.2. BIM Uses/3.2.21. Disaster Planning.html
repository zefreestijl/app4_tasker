    <p>
        A process in which emergency responders would have access to critical building information in the form of a model and information system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The BIM would provide critical building information to the responders that would improve the efficiency of the response and minimize the safety risks. The dynamic building information would be provided by a building automation system (BAS), while the static building information, such as floor plans and equipment schematics, would reside in a BIM model. These two systems would be integrated via a wireless connection and emergency responders would be linked to an overall system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The BIM coupled with the BAS would be able to clearly display where the emergency was located within the building, possible routes to the area, and any other harmful locations within the building.
