<p>These assets, consisting of the physical building, systems, surrounding environment, and equipment, must be maintained, upgraded, and operated at an efficiency which will satisfy both the Appointing Party and users in the most cost effective manner. It assists in financial decision-making, short-term and long-term planning, and generating scheduled work orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asset Management utilizes the data contained in a record model to populate an asset management system which is then used to determine cost implications of changing or upgrading building assets, segregate costs of assets for financial tax purposes, and maintain a current comprehensive database that can produce the value of a company's assets. The bi-directional link also allows users to visualize the asset in the model before servicing it potentially reducing service time.</p>
