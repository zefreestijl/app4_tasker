Virtual mock-ups can be performed at various levels of detail depending on project needs. An example of this is to create a highly detailed model of a small portion of the building, such as a facade to quickly analyze design alternatives and solve design and constructibility issues.</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Potential Value:&nbsp;</div></th></tr></thead></table><ul><li>Eliminate costly and timely traditional construction mock-ups</li><li>Different design options and alternatives may be easily modeled and changed in real-time during design review base on end users and/or Appointing Party feedback</li><li>Create shorter and more efficient design and design review process</li><li>Evaluate effectiveness of design in meeting building program criteria and Appointing Party's needs</li><li>Enhance the health, safety and welfare performance of their projects (For instance, BIM can be used to analyze and compare fire-rated egress enclosures, automatic sprinkler system designs, and alternate stair layouts)</li><li>Easily communicate the design to the Appointing Party, construction team and end users</li><li>Get instant feedback on meeting program requirements, Appointing Party's needs and building or space aesthetics</li><li>Greatly increase coordination and communication between different parties.
