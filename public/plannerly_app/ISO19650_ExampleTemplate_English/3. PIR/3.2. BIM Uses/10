Applying sustainable features to a project in the planning and early design phases is more effective (ability to impact design) and efficient (cost and schedule of decisions).&nbsp;</p><p>This comprehensive process requires more disciplines to interact earlier by providing valuable insights. This integration may require contractual integration in the planning phase. In addition to achieving sustainable goals, having LEED approval process adds certain calculations, documentations, and verification. Energy simulations, calculations, and documentations can be performed within an integrative environment when responsibilities are well defined and clearly shared.</p><p><br></p><table style="width: 100%;"><thead><tr><th><div style="text-align: left;">Potential Value:&nbsp;</div></th></tr></thead></table><ul><li>Facilitates interaction, collaboration, and coordination of team members early in the project process are considered to be favorable to sustainable projects.</li><li>Enables early and reliable evaluation of design alternatives.</li><li>Availability of critical information early helps problem resolution efficiently in terms of cost premium and schedule conflicts.</li><li>Shortens the actual design process by the help of early facilitated design decisions.
