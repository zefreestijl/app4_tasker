    <p>
        A process in which BIM is used to graphically represent both permanent and temporary facilities on site during multiple phases of the construction process. It may also be linked with the construction activity schedule to convey space and sequencing requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additional information incorporated into the model can include labor resources, materials with associated deliveries, and equipment location. Because the 3D model components can be directly linked to the schedule, site management functions such as visualized planning, short-term re-planning, and resource analysis can be analyzed over different spatial and temporal data.
