    <p>
        A process in which stakeholders view a 3D model and provide their feedback to validate multiple design aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
        These aspects include evaluating meeting the program, previewing space aesthetics and layout in a virtual environment, and setting criteria such as layout, sight-lines, lighting, security, ergonomics, acoustics, textures and colors, etc. This BIM use can be done by using computer software only or with special virtual mock-up facilities, such as CAVE (Computer Assisted Virtual Environment) and immersive lab.
    </p>
    <p>
        Virtual mock-ups can be performed at various levels of detail depending on project needs. An example of this is to create a highly detailed model of a small portion of the building, such as a facade to quickly analyze design alternatives and solve design and constructibility issues.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Potential Value</h3>
        <ul class="styled-checklist">
            <li>Eliminate costly and timely traditional construction mock-ups</li>
            <li>Different design options and alternatives may be easily modeled and changed in real-time during design review base on end users and/or Appointing Party feedback</li>
            <li>Create shorter and more efficient design and design review process</li>
            <li>Evaluate effectiveness of design in meeting building program criteria and Appointing Party's needs</li>
            <li>Enhance the health, safety and welfare performance of their projects (For instance, BIM can be used to analyze and compare fire-rated egress enclosures, automatic sprinkler system designs, and alternate stair layouts)</li>
            <li>Easily communicate the design to the Appointing Party, construction team and end users</li>
            <li>Get instant feedback on meeting program requirements, Appointing Party's needs and building or space aesthetics</li>
            <li>Greatly increase coordination and communication between different parties. More likely to generate better decisions for design</li>
        </ul>
