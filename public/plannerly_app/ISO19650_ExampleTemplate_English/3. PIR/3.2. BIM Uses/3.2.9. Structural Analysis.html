    <p>
        A process in which analytical modeling software utilizes the BIM design authoring model so to determine the behavior of a given structural system.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the modeling minimum required standards for structural design and analysis are used for optimization. Based on this analysis further development and refinement of the structural design takes place to create effective, efficient, and constructible structural systems. The development of this information is the basis for what will be passed onto the digital fabrication and construction system design phases.
    </p>
    <p>
        This BIM Use does not need to be implemented from the beginning of the design to be beneficial. Often structural analysis is implemented at the connection design level to make fabrication quicker, more efficient and for better coordination during construction. Another application is that this relates and ties into is construction system design, examples include but not limited to: erection design, construction means and methods, and rigging. The application of this analysis tool allows for performance simulations that can significantly improve the design, performance, and safety of the facility over its lifecycle.
