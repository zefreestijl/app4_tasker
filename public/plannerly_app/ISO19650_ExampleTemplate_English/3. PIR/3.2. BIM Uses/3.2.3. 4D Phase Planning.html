    <p>
        A process in which a 4D model (3D models with the added dimension of time) is utilized to effectively plan the phased occupancy in a renovation, retrofit, addition, or to show the construction sequence and space requirements on a building site.
    </p>
    <p>
        4D modeling is a powerful visualization and communication tool that can give a project team, including the Appointing Party, a better understanding of project milestones and construction plans.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Potential Value</h3>
        <ul class="styled-checklist">
            <li>Better understanding of the phasing schedule by the Appointing Party and project participants and showing the critical path of the project</li>
            <li>Dynamic phasing plans of occupancy offering multiple options and solutions to space conflicts</li>
            <li>Integrate planning of human, equipment and material resources with the model to better schedule and cost estimate the project</li>
            <li>Space and workspace conflicts identified and resolved ahead of the construction process</li>
            <li>Marketing purposes and publicity</li>
            <li>Identification of schedule, sequencing or phasing issues</li>
            <li>More readily constructible, operable and maintainable project</li>
            <li>Monitor procurement status of project materials</li>
            <li>Increased productivity and decreased waste on job sites</li>
            <li>Conveying the spatial complexities of the project, planning information, and support conducting additional analyses</li>

            <li>Knowledge of construction scheduling and general construction process. A 4D model is connected to a schedule, and is therefore only as good as the schedule to which it is linked.</li>
            <li>Ability to manipulate, navigate, and review a 3D model.</li>
            <li>Knowledge of 4D software: import geometry, manage links to schedules, produce and control animations, etc.</li>
