    <p>
        A process in which BIM is utilized to effectively distribute, manage, and track appropriate spaces and related resources within a facility.
    </p>
    <p>
        A facility building information model allows the facility management team to analyze the existing use of the space and effectively apply transition planning management towards any applicable changes. Such applications are particularly useful during a project's renovation where building segments are to remain occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
        Space Management and Tracking ensures the appropriate allocation of spatial resources throughout the life of the facility. This use benefits from the utilization of the record model. This application often requires integration with spatial tracking software.
