<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">All models of the building will use the Location at Latitude: 0°, Longitude: 0° in the Architectural model as a shared base point that must be used by the entire project team for building coordination purposes.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">A .dwg file named "GRIDS" locates the building structural grid lines relative to the project origin.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">All models of site utilities will use a coordinate system separate from the building coordinate system and will be based on the Civil Site drawings.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">The General Contractor will coordinate the placement of this point first and all other models will follow.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Each model will be aligned and rotated so that when exporting to the various shared formats, they will align without requiring the exports to be moved or rotated.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">This process will be worked out as the coordination begins and published in a document that can be accessed by the entire team. This will allow for all points in the models to be spatially located in the correct location. Additionally, this will allow for the sharing and use of coordinate point data between all trades for field location and installation.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Note to all Revit users – The origin marker, “Base Point”, and “Shared Coordinate” should all be in the same place in your models. You can then use the site/civil information to “locate” the project for solar studies, heat days, lighting, etc…</span></li>
