            Model Quality Control ensures that models are <strong>accurate, consistent, and fit for their intended use</strong> at each stage of the project. Checks focus on geometry, data completeness, coordination, and compliance with the agreed information requirements, supporting reliable verification, issue resolution, and controlled information exchange.

        <p>Model coordination confirms that elements fit together. <strong>Information verification confirms that the right information has been delivered.</strong> The Plannerly verify module is used to verify models and documents against the project’s information requirements, helping teams confirm completeness and accountability before sharing or acceptance.</p>
