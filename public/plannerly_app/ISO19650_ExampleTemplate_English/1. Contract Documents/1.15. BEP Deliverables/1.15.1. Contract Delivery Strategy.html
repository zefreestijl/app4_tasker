        <p style="margin-top:0;">The project is being delivered under the agreed contract form and delivery method defined by the Client. BIM requirements are applied in a way that supports this delivery approach, ensuring that information responsibilities, coordination activities, and model outputs are clearly defined and achievable within the contractual structure.</p>
        
        <p>BIM roles, responsibilities, and deliverables are aligned with the appointment scope of each party. Information requirements defined in the EIR and confirmed through this BEP form part of the contractual obligations and shall be complied with throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Team members are appointed based on their demonstrated capability to deliver the required BIM Uses, comply with project information standards, and operate within the agreed Common Data Environment. All parties are expected to follow the defined coordination, verification, and information exchange processes to support collaborative delivery and reduce risk.</p>
