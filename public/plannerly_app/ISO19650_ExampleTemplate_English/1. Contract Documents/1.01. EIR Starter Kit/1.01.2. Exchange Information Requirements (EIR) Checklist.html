            <li><strong>Review the pre-filled EIR sections and understand the Owner’s information needs</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Complete all highlighted Smart Fields in this EIR template</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Ensure your responses focus on operational needs, not delivery methods</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Follow any inline guidance provided within each section</strong></li>

        <div class="why-matter-box">
            <strong>Why this matters:</strong> 
            Completing the EIR ensures the Owner’s information needs are clearly defined before structuring how that information will be delivered. This creates a strong foundation for consistent scope definition, tendering, and verification.

        <summary class="checklist-summary">2. Creating the EIR (in Scope)</summary>
        
        <p>Follow the instructions in the <strong>“Define the information requirements in Scope”</strong> section of this template to complete this step.</p>
        
        

        <ul class="styled-checklist">
            <li><strong>Create discipline folders in Scope: Architecture, Mechanical, Electrical</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Add tasks under each folder: Interior Walls, Air Terminals, Mechanical Equipment, Lighting Fixtures, Cable Tray with Fittings</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Rename Milestone 1 to Operation</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Import the CSV: <a href="https://files.plannerly.com/projects/e50dd673-007d-4028-bbd3-2c56fb09a48a/plan-content/1764599197933_1c97ad91-ee74-435b-b51c-83eca302a7e9.csv" target="_blank">Plannerly Assignment Information Requirement Import Template.csv</a></strong></li>
            <li><strong>Assign the correct information requirements in the Operation column for each task (use the reference image provided)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="why-matter-box">
            <strong>Why this matters:</strong> 
            Structuring information requirements in Scope makes responsibilities clear and ensures requirements can be issued as part of a tender package. It connects the Owner’s needs to specific deliverables and disciplines in a way that can be verified and managed.

        <ul class="styled-checklist">
            <li>Your EIR document is created in Docs and reflects the Owner’s strategic goal.</li>
            <li>Your Scope includes discipline folders, tasks, and Operation milestone assignments.</li>
            <li>Exported your completed EIR - including the defined scope - as a single document in the File Manager.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="why-matter-box">
            <strong>Why this matters:</strong> 
            Exporting a completed EIR turns defined requirements into a contract-ready deliverable. This enables the document to be used as part of a tender package, setting clear expectations for prospective teams.
