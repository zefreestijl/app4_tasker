            A successful project relies on a clear plan, defined responsibilities, agreed processes, and the right supporting technology. The <strong>BIM Execution Plan (BEP)</strong> explains <strong>how</strong> the project team will deliver the information requested in the EIR in a consistent, coordinated, and verifiable way.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
            This BEP sets out the processes, standards, milestones, and controls that will be followed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure information is created, reviewed, shared, and approved in line with the agreed requirements.

        <div class="note-title">Why this matters:</div>
        <p>Projects often generate large volumes of data, but very little usable information. Successful information management ensures that information is agreed, tracked, and verified before it is shared, reducing confusion between teams and improving coordination outcomes.</p>
