        <div class="note-title">Why this matters</div>
        <p>Defining BIM Uses keeps information requirements purpose-driven, not model-driven. Each BIM Use clarifies why information is needed, what value it provides, and what must be delivered — helping the project team align models, data, and verification to the Owner’s goals.</p>
