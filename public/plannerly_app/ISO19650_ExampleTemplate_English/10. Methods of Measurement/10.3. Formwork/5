<p>This method offers more precise quantities by considering not only element intersections but also specific features like inclination and openings.</p>
<p>Moreover, it ensures traceability of the modeled quantities.</p>
<p>However, its use is limited when applied to complex geometry like stairs and "model in-place" elements.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
