        <p>
            The authoring software's specific add-ins for formwork quantification analyze structural elements such as beams, columns, slabs, and walls, reporting their surface area.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prevent material waste and potential negative cost impacts, it's crucial to consider the interaction between structural elements during the quantity takeoff process, ensuring alignment with actual construction techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            This interaction-based approach is exemplified in "Scenario 02" of Figure 03.

                Figure 03 - Illustration of surface area-based (derived) quantity takeoff. While Scenario 01 quantifies all sides and bottom faces of the elements disregarding intersections, Scenario 02 represents these relationships being considered.

        <p>
            Some commercial solutions on the market calculate surface area by deducting intersected parts from other elements. This data is then computed and added to each instance as a new parameter.

            <p style="margin: 0; color: #333;">
                <strong>Requirement:</strong> Either way, the quantification should follow the construction methodology and be clearly described in the <strong>BoQ</strong>.
