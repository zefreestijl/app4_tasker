        <p>
            Customized add-ins within the authoring software involve selecting structural elements from the model and defining rules to model formwork geometry and extract quantities in the schedule.

        <p>
            This method offers more precise quantities by considering not only element intersections but also specific features like inclination and openings. Moreover, it ensures traceability of the modeled quantities.

                <strong>Limitation:</strong> However, its use is limited when applied to complex geometry like stairs and "model in-place" elements.
