        <p>
            Measure the length of the pipes added to the length of the fittings, in meters, as illustrated in Figure 12.

        <p>
            This measurement methodology results in a <strong>more accurate estimate</strong> of the total network length compared to ratio methodology, considering that the length of the fittings is directly obtained from the models.
        </p>
    
        <div style="background-color: #f0f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #2c82c9; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
            <p style="margin: 0; color: #333;">
                <strong>Technical Requirement:</strong> Independently of the employed authoring tool, the length of the fittings must be reported through a parameter that calculates it based on the specific dimensions of each element.
            </p>

        <p>
            As a result, this technique is applied during the <strong>Estimate</strong> and <strong>Design</strong> project phases.

            <p style="margin: 0; color: #856404;">
                <strong>Risk:</strong> However, it is crucial to consider the inherent risks associated with this approach, particularly when the design demands fittings with big dimensions or special features, as it may have implications on cost estimation.
