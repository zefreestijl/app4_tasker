            This technique involves adjusting the default join order of modeled elements to align with the geometry requirement of rules of measurement.
        </p>
        <p>
            This adjustment ensures that the connections between elements follow the prescribed guidelines, as illustrated in Figure 01. Although authoring BIM tools offer options for altering join orders, this process often requires manual intervention. External plugins can streamline the process by automating join order adjustments based on hierarchical rules among elements.

                <strong>Quality Check:</strong> While following this path, it is crucial to conduct thorough quality checks on the model to verify the accuracy of join orders, particularly if the model will be used as a reference for early-stage rebar estimates.

        <p>
            Additionally, incorporating the material specifications of structural elements into the model is equally important. This step can influence join orders and impact the corresponding concrete volume calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The model modification approach not only provides the flexibility to adapt the concrete model for early-stage rebar estimates but also remains well-suited for companies to retain the efficiency of their default modeling processes while ensuring quantities align with specific measurement standards.
