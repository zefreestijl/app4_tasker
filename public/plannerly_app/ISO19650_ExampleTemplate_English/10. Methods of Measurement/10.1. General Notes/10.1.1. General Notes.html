                <strong>Standardization Requirement:</strong> It's essential for the <strong>EIR</strong> and the <strong>BIM Execution Plan (BEP)</strong> of the project to outline the preferred quantification approach for each discipline based on the options presented here. This ensures a standardized approach throughout the project.

            It's important to note that these suggestions were developed with the idea of their applicability across different software platforms. However, there might be room for adjustments to accommodate the particularity of distinct software.

            To optimize the utilization of BIM in alignment with the forthcoming guidelines, specific information must be integrated into the models to prepare them for quantity takeoff, as described by chapter 1.2.
