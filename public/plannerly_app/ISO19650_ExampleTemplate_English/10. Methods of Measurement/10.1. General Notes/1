<p>Considering the diversity of methods available for determining quantities, this guide offers a curated list of strategies for extracting quantities from the models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's essential for the EIR and the BIM Execution Plan (BEP) of the project to outline the preferred quantification approach for each discipline based on the options presented here. This ensures a standardized approach throughout the project.</p>
<p>It's important to note that these suggestions were developed with the idea of their applicability across different software platforms. However, there might be room for adjustments to accommodate the particularity of distinct software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To optimize the utilization of BIM in alignment with the forthcoming guidelines, specific information must be integrated into the models to prepare them for quantity takeoff, as described by chapter 1.2.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
