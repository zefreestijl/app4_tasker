            These elements should be measured by the <strong>surface area</strong>, in square meters or feet (as illustrated in Figure 16) in any project phase.

            There are BIM authoring tools that natively provide this area for ducts; however, in cases where this information is not natively available (such as for duct fittings), <strong>new parameters must be introduced</strong> to calculate and report these areas.

            <p style="margin: 0; color: #333;">
                <strong>Special Case (Insulation/Fire Protection):</strong> It is necessary to consider these as a <strong>distinct typology</strong> from regular ducts. Any specific characteristics in the composition of these elements should result in a new element type/class, enabling more accurate and detailed quantity takeoff.
