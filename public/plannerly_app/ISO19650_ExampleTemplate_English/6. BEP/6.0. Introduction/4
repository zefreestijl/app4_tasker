<ul>
<li>Standardize the production process and maintain uniformity across projects and regions</li>
<li>Create a standardized data structure that allows data to be reused, and eliminates redundant and conflicting information</li>
<li>Decrease waste by utilizing a virtual building process to simulate design &amp; construction activities</li>
<li>Reduce CAPEX (capital expenditure) costs with better informed decision making and greater coordination &amp; collaboration amongst project teams</li>
<li>Allow the Design and Construction models to be used for building operations without adding significant costs or time to the Design &amp; Construction process</li>
<li>Visual communication of site conditions for planning and health/safety/risk assessment</li>
<li>More accurate project phasing and timelines</li>
<li>More accurate budgeting and cost estimating, ensuring the project is constructed with the least variations / clashes as possible</li>
<li>Fully clash detected models that reduce RFI’s requesting data on object location, with an emphasis on clash avoidance</li>
<li>Utilize 3D models for reporting, review and decision making</li>
<li>Ensure that there is coordinated, quality Design documentation to estimate the build cost</li>
<li>Ensure that the constructibility and methodology of the design have been assessed before documents are issued for construction</li>
