            A successful project requires a smart plan, lean scope, collaborative processes, team agreement, supporting technology, and solid tracking, control, and verification workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project execution planning ensures that all parties are clearly aware of the opportunities and responsibilities associated with the incorporation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) into our project. Our plan details the correct processes for executing BIM throughout the project's lifecycle.
        </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title">Execution Steps</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">On this project, we will follow these four steps to ensure that all teams are meeting the project's Exchange Information Requirements:</p>

            <img src="../../public/img/6.0.2.1.png" alt="Plannerly Templates">

            <ol style="margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6; color: #333;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Identify</strong> high value Model/BIM Uses that will support Exchange Information Requirements.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Design and document</strong> optimal project execution processes.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Define</strong> the BIM deliverables in the form of information exchanges.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Develop the infrastructure</strong> in the form of contracts, communication procedures, technology, and quality control to support the implementation.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            To gain the maximum benefits from our BIM implementation, once the <strong>Plan</strong> and <strong>Scope</strong> have been defined and appointed, the Task Teams will <strong>Schedule</strong> their own tasks. Our team will then <strong>Track</strong> the progress of assigned tasks and <strong>Verify</strong> task completeness <strong>before sharing the model for the described use case.</strong>
