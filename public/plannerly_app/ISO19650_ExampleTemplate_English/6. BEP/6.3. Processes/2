<p>The Civil/ Site will align with the State Plane Coordinates.</p>
<p>The building origin will need to be selected and have a real physical location to act as a control point (example; the South West most point of the site). A physical monument can be placed (if not already existing) on site of the project (example; (+5,+5,+1 &nbsp;from the property line). Consider Frost Lines and Vehicle traffic to avoid having to relocate the monument.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Monument / Origin Marker should be placed in the Site Civil Drawings and all models (Design, Engineering, Shop, Fabrication, Civil, etc...). A 3D Text near the origin point can be placed near the marker with the building coordinates (example: Origin = N472,250, E2,228,070 - rotation 24.5 degrees).</p>
<p>Determine a control point "Building Origin" within the building - usually (example: Column/ Grid line A1 as finish slab is N 520 ft, E 785 ft/ height 4.5 ft. from the "monument". Usually Architectural and Structural will coordinate this first and all other design models follow.</p>
<p>Note to all Revit users – The origin marker, “Base Point”, and “Shared Coordinate” should all be in the same place in your models. You can then use the site/civil information to “locate” the project for solar studies, heat days, lighting, etc… You will need a second “Site Location” created for the IFC export so that the project will not be miles from the origin.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
