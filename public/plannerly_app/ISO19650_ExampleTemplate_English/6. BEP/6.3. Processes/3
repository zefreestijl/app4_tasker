<p>To facilitate this, we will use an open standard for managing issues on a BIM project called BCF (BIM Collaboration Format).</p>
<p>BCF allows project team members to identify and communicate issues related to the project model in a structured way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes the ability to assign issues to specific team members, add comments and attachments, and track the status of issues over time.</p>
<p>The BCF-API (Application Programming Interface) supports the exchange of BCF issues between software applications via a RESTful web interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that different software tools used by different project team members can communicate and share issue information seamlessly.</p>
<p>Our project will use the BCF format for issue management to help streamline the project management process, reduce errors and omissions, and improve communication and collaboration between team members.</p>
