        <p>
            In addition to the Information Requirements added in the <strong>Scope</strong> module, here we include any specific BIM requirements stated by the Appointing Party/Owner.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important that the Appointing Party's requirements for BIM be considered early so that they can be incorporated into the project’s BIM processes. The completeness of these requirements will depend heavily on the Appointing Party's understanding of the benefits that BIM can bring.

        <p>
            Our goal is to educate where necessary (in how BIM helps in the operation and maintenance of a building), ask targeted questions, and define <strong>SMART</strong> (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) requirements.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the questions we will ask the Appointing Party:</p>
