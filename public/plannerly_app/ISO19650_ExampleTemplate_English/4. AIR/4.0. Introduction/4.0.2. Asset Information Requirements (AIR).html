        <div class="section-label">Asset Information Requirements (AIR)</div>

        <p>
            Asset Information Requirements (AIR) define the specific information needed about assets to support their
            ongoing operation, maintenance, and long-term management. These requirements are essential for enabling
            informed decision-making throughout the asset lifecycle from handover to replacement or refurbishment.
        </p>
        <p>
            AIR is typically developed at the early stages of a project to ensure that critical operational data is
            identified in advance and delivered during design and construction.
        </p>



        <div class="subsection-box">
            <h3 class="subsection-title">AIR Scope and Operational Use Cases</h3>
            <ul class="styled-checklist">
                <li>Schedule and perform preventive and reactive maintenance</li>
                <li>Manage health, safety, and compliance requirements</li>
                <li>Track warranty periods, asset history, and performance</li>
                <li>Support energy, sustainability, and cost management</li>
                <li>Integrate with facility management systems or digital twins</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            AIR should be defined by or on behalf of the <strong>Appointing Party</strong> (or by a Representative,
            Advisor or Consultant that we have appointed). It can be developed in collaboration with Facilities
            Management (FM) teams, asset managers, or specialist advisors to ensure that delivered information genuinely
            supports operational use.
        </p>
        <p>
            As per <strong>ISO 19650-2, Clause 5.2.1</strong>, the <strong>AIR</strong> is part of our <strong>Exchange
                Information Requirements (EIR)</strong> and must be clearly defined if the project supports operational
            use.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this document, we’re not focusing on structured data such as IFC and COBie mappings, file formats,
            verification rules, and delivery assignments yet; that happens in the Scope module <strong>(Docs +
                Scope)</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This AIR document serves as a <strong>planning tool</strong> to identify <strong>what operational data we
                need, why, and how we’ll use it.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            When we set our AIR early in the project, we help the delivery team understand:
        </p>
        <ul class="styled-checklist">
            <li><strong>Which assets matter most to us</strong></li>
            <li><strong>What kind of information we expect for those assets</strong></li>
            <li><strong>How we intend to use that information after handover</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This improves the way information is structured, tracked, and validated during the project. It also reduces
            the risk of missing or inconsistent data at the end.
        </p>
        <p class="p1">While our <span class="s2"><strong>structured AIR</strong></span> including IFC and COBie
            mappings, verification rules, and delivery assignments will be created in the <span
