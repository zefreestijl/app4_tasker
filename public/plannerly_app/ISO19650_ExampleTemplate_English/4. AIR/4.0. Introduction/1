<p class="p1">While our actual AIR will be defined, assigned, and tracked in Scope, this document gives us the space to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="p1">Think clearly about what we want to know about our assets</p></li>
<li><p class="p1">Explain why that information matters to our day-to-day operations</p></li>
<li><p class="p1">Align internally across teams (e.g. FM, estates, digital, compliance)</p></li>
<li><p class="p1">Give the project team a head start in understanding our expectations</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This document acts as a <span class="s1"><strong>strategic reference</strong></span> — a way for us to clarify our intentions so that the delivery team can respond meaningfully.</p>
<p class="p1">By working through this document, we create a shared understanding of what <strong>“useful handover data”&nbsp;</strong>looks like and avoid the common problem of being handed folders or files full of information no one asked for or knows how to use.</p>
<p class="p1">Completing this AIR guide helps us:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="p1"><strong>Understand what information about each asset is actually important</strong></p></li>
<li><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Link our operational goals to specific data points</strong></span> (e.g., tracking uptime, safety inspections, or energy use)</p></li>
<li><p class="p1"><strong>Collaborate with internal and external stakeholders</strong><span class="s1">&nbsp;to refine expectations</span></p></li>
<li><p class="p1"><strong>Prepare to define structured AIR inside the Scope module</strong><span class="s1">, with the right properties, formats, and rules</span></p></li>
</ul></div></div></div></div></div></div>
