<p class="p1">AIR is typically developed at the early stages of a project to ensure that critical operational data is identified in advance and delivered during design and construction. </p>

<p class="p1">AIR should be defined by or on behalf of the <span class="s2"><strong>Appointing Party</strong> (or by a Representative, Advisor or Consultant that we have appointed)</span>. It can be developed in collaboration with Facilities Management (FM) teams, asset managers, or specialist advisors to ensure that delivered information genuinely supports operational use.</p>
<p data-pasted="true">As per <strong>ISO 19650-2, Clause 5.2.1,</strong> the <strong>AIR</strong> is part of our <strong>Exchange Information Requirements (EIR) </strong>and must be clearly defined if the project supports operational use.</p>
<p>In this document, we’re not focusing on structured data such as IFC and COBie mappings, file formats, verification rules, and delivery assignments yet, that happens in the Scope module<strong> (Docs + Scope).</strong> This AIR document serves as a <span class="s2" data-pasted="true">planning tool</span> to identify <strong>what operational data we need, why, and how we’ll use it.</strong></p>
<p class="p1" data-pasted="true">When we set our AIR early in the project, we help the delivery team understand:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="p1"><strong>Which assets matter most to us</strong></p></li>
<li><p class="p1"><strong>What kind of information we expect for those assets</strong></p></li>
<li><p class="p1"><strong>How we intend to use that information after handover</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">This improves the way information is structured, tracked, and validated during the project. It also reduces the risk of missing or inconsistent data at the end.</p>
<p class="p1">While our <span class="s2"><strong>structured AIR</strong></span> including IFC and COBie mappings, verification rules, and delivery assignments will be created in the <span class="s2"><strong>Plannerly Scope module (<strong data-pasted="true">Docs + Scope). </strong></strong></span></p>
